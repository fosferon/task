# MetaMemory Implementation Status

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

The new topic-based metamemory system has been successfully implemented and integrated into the Task framework.

### Key Components Implemented:

1. **Topic Thread Management**
   - Messages are automatically categorized into topic threads
   - Threads have states: Core, Active, Idle, Archived, Ephemeral
   - State transitions based on activity and token limits

2. **Message Tagging**
   - LLM-based tagger categorizes messages into topics
   - Supports topic relationships (parent-child)
   - Identifies core instructions and ephemeral content

3. **Thread Compaction**
   - Automatic compaction when threads exceed token limits
   - State-specific summarization (light, heavy, archival)
   - Preserves recent messages while summarizing older content

4. **Context Assembly**
   - Dynamically builds prompts with relevant context
   - Includes core instructions, active threads, idle summaries
   - Vector search for recalling archived topics

5. **Background Processing**
   - Asynchronous processing to avoid blocking main conversation
   - Configurable processing intervals and thresholds

### Integration Points:

- ✅ Integrated with runTask in the engine
- ✅ State management through taskState
- ✅ Configuration via configureMetamemory
- ✅ Enable/disable with setMetamemoryEnabled
- ✅ Full TypeScript support with proper types
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

### Testing:

- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (12 tests, all passing)
- ✅ Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality
- ✅ Demo application updated to support metamemory

### Demo Status:

The demo is functional and running on:
- WebSocket server: ws://localhost:3020
- Web interface: http://localhost:3021

Note: API keys need to be configured in the .env file for actual LLM calls to work.
